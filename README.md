# Safety
This repository is dedicated to my Ph.D. thesis, which focuses on safety for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) using different frameworks.

## Directories
Paper: Contains the research paper on safety for UAVs.

Projects: Includes various implementations using different approaches to safety, such as Average Reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and partial differential Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) formulations.

## Overall Details
The code is written in the Julia programming language, and the Gurobi package is used for optimization tasks.
